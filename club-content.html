                                <h1>Mint Or It Didn't Happen</h1>
                                <p>By 2030 let’s assume that we were successful in onboarding most normies to blockchain culture. Everyone’s got their favorite non fungies & digital art is in a full swing renaissance.</p>
                                <p>XCOPY’s work is priced in the stratosphere. All the people from 2020-2022 are household names. Let’s do a thought experiment.</p>
                                <h2>Minter A</h2>
                                <p>Highly selective with their mints back then. Overly stressed about ‘scarcity’ & ‘curating’ a collector base. They minted around 50 total pieces in those years. The ‘grail years’.</p>
                                <h2>Minter B</h2>
                                <p>Highly experimental with their mints back then. Not too concerned with ‘scarcity’ or even upholding a ‘quality standard’ for their collectors. They minted around 300 total pieces in those years. The ‘grail years’.</p>
                                <h2>There are a couple questions here</h2>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Who is likely to have better S&D dynamics</li>
                                    <li>Who is likely to have a bigger collector base</li>
                                    <li>Who is likely to have their work meme’d</li>
                                    <li>Who is likely to be more relevant in history</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Depending on what you are trying to accomplish you will choose A or B. I don’t really have a horse in your race so no need to get dogmatic.</p>
                                <p>This thought experiment is for the artists that want to mint more. The ones that want to tag the blockchain with their signature while it’s still naked, but maybe they’re insecure about it.</p>
                                <p>Artists are fickle. Many of them do what they are told in all areas of their life outside of creativity time. They mint when told. The collect when told. They get on their soap box when told. It’s human nature to a certain degree and I don’t fault them for it. I do take up arms when they start controlling the narrative however.</p>
                                <img src="Images/content-1.png" alt="mint-meme">
                                <p>If you want to mint it… mint it. If it doesn’t sell now maybe it will tomorrow, or next year, or 2030, or never - does it really matter?</p>
                                <p>My prediction is by 2030 the years 2020-2022 will be revered in the manner 2017-2018 are right now. The work of artists that stuck around and kept building will be considered ‘grails’. And I genuinely believe the artists that only minted a handful of work, but still are around, will look somewhat silly for not maximizing the opportunity to put art in the rafters of blockchain history.</p>
                                <p>Just my opinion though.</p>

                                <h1>Art Isn't Priceless. It's valuable.</h1>
                                <p>I saw this quote from @entropy a while back - "creatives are the new athletes."</p>
                                <p>What a wonderful way to put it. If you look at the comedy renaissance you can see the effects of this meme in full effect.</p>
                                <p>Look to Joe Rogan, Tom Segura, Bert Kreischer, Bill Burr, Whitney Cummings, Andrew Santino, Bobby Lee, Akaash Singh, Andrew Schulz, Tim Dillon, and on and on and on the list goes.</p>
                                <p>Joe Rogan, as controversial as he has become, is an athlete at his core. He’s a martial artist and he has taken what he’s learned about discipline & hard work from athletics and transferred the tenants to his podcast & comedy - creative mediums. (Turned out pretty well)</p>
                                <p>He has also instilled those same tenants to all the comedians I named above. I’ve been watching this renaissance mature for roughly 7 yrs now & there is so much digital artist can learn from it.</p>
                                <h2>First</h2>
                                <p>Discipline = Freedom.</p>
                                <p>It’s counterintuitive for creatives. I know this because I had my own mental battles with it.</p>
                                <p>The goal of art is freedom. Freedom to express yourself however you wish. Freedom to talk, think, and wonder about anything and everything. No matter if the subject matter is ‘nasty’ or ‘pleasant’ the medium provides freedom.</p>
                                <p>The proverbial ‘they’ don’t tell you how corrosive of an addiction the freedom drug can become though. I had to learn this the hard way.</p>
                                <p>A plausible scenario goes like this. You start making art… and it’s shit because you just started. But it was fun and you keep going. Before long, you are making stuff you want to show the people you care about. It brings you happiness and you want to share that with others. “Look at these new discoveries I’ve made about myself and the world around me!”</p>
                                <p>It feels like magic. And in some sense it is, but maybe not in the direction we originally assume. So you keep on creating and getting better. You get so good that you start making masterpieces each time you sit in front of your canvas of choice. Now you’re stuntin’ - this shit has gotten easy.</p>
                                <p>There’s a couple traps at this stage of the path. A few that I fell into and had to spend years crawling out of. They are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>mistaking this developed skill for something it’s not</li>
                                    <li>confusing creativity with ‘omnipresence’</li>
                                    <li>assuming others should care about it at all</li>
                                    <li>feeling content enough to stop progression</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h2>Memeware</h2>
                                <p>If we work under the ‘creatives are the new athletes’ meme then we can understand that we’re the new kids on the block. Sports entertainment is a multi billion dollar industry. People buy tickets, memorabilia, souvenirs, content packages, & miscellaneous expenses circling the main event. It is a developed skill that has a place, understood as the result of hard work, cared about by others through proper incentives, and continually developing.</p>
                                <p>What about ‘art’ though? How’s that hold up so far? It’s so rhetorical I almost didn’t write it.</p>
                                <p>Artists confuse the hard work they put in getting better for ‘ordained gifts’. They misunderstand their creativity for a mystical beneficence. And they chastise the very incentives that would make people care about consuming their work (ie. smart business) for some moral high ground argument about ‘purity’.</p>
                                <p>That messy cocktail usually ends with them halting progression when they feel things aren’t as easy as they ‘should’ be anymore. It’s out of love I write this. Tough love sure, but love nonetheless. Without discipline, they lose the freedom they had.</p>
                                <p>If you’ve ever played sports or competitive games you know that a grandmaster or professional athlete has dedicated serious time and attention to the trade - real discipline. The part artists seem to confuse themselves over is what that range entails.</p>
                                <p>Let’s stick with pro athletes. They spend tons of time and energy on getting better at their sport, sure. But they all spend tons of time and energy on:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>diet and nutrition</li>
                                    <li>rest and recovery</li>
                                    <li>media & press obligations</li>
                                    <li>sponsorships & endorsements</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Without those four they wouldn’t be a ‘professional’ athlete. So why does an artist think they can just make art they like and become a ‘professional’ artist? Why do they think they can make a living with no discipline?</p>
                                <h2>Beating a dead horse?</h2>
                                <p>I’ll keep banging the drum as long as I feel I need to. The work ethic of many artists is atrocious. The mentality of many artists is unsustainable. The independence, or lack there of, is depressing. I know because I’ve been there myself. I know because I couldn’t write this without having lived it.</p>
                                <p>It’s not a judgement about existential worth. It’s not even directed at most artists that just do this as hobby. It’s a wake up call that if professional artists want to be involved in the next renaissance… they have to do more.</p>
                                <p>Abstraverse is going to take me another 2.5 years to distribute. During that time I’ll be building public facing verticals for AV Club. Two of those verts (memeware & cc0) are pointed at this exact problem. We don’t have enough ‘creative athletes’. I’m working on that.</p>
                                <p>My hopes are that some will resonate with what we’re building, can add to or learn from it, & can pass the torch on like Jack Butcher did for me.</p>

                                <p>A flash of inspiration manifests a fuzzy picture in my minds eye. The Zora State of Mind image & Pepe the frog - my ego tells my intuition it’s going to accept the muse’s contract. I’ve got to workout first though, and there’s new drama with the Friendsie rug finally confirmed.</p>
                                <p>HYPERSPEEED onchain & new creative space to play with, I’ve returned to v4 Midjourney with new tactics & ideas. Hyperpop, Enlghtenment, & now Algo Art Dealers.</p>
                                <img src="" alt="">
                                <p>Earlier that evening I completed my ‘muse contract’ on MEMEWARE. Like most contracts I just shut up and get to work. The message is usually easier to understand in hindsight I’ve learned.</p>
                                <p>And in some instances, with this being one of them, a bonus contract from the muse pops up after finishing the initial one. Algo Art Dealers is that bonus piece. One that provides multiple avenues of investigation.</p>
                                <p>To understand what “memeware” means to me, is to understand what software is. It is also understanding what memes are, why we use story, & the power of words (internally and collectively).</p>
                                <p>Assuming all that is common knowledge to the reader, Algo Art Dealers builds off of some of those foundations. It also dabbles in the conceptual reality of tech-x-culture (culture influenced by tech, not technology culture).</p>
                                <h2>The art</h2>
                                <p>Initially the core idea was that we build something using robots, art dealing aesthetics (Sotheby’s), and add in some abstraction for necessary flavor - beyond that it’s an informalism approach.</p>
                                <p>In hindsight, I see my curiosity/confusion in the current art world at the meta & anecdotal level starting to crystallize finally. Daily involvement in a new art world has left me with many questions. Here’s one:</p>
                                <p>Do you think more people would know of Beeple or Monet? Well I ran a poll ↓</p>
                                <div><figure><div class="css-yjg541"><div class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" style="display: flex; max-width: 550px; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><iframe id="twitter-widget-0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="" style="position: static; visibility: visible; width: 512px; height: 401px; display: block; flex-grow: 1;" title="Twitter Tweet" src="https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?dnt=false&amp;embedId=twitter-widget-0&amp;features=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%3D&amp;frame=false&amp;hideCard=false&amp;hideThread=false&amp;id=1628287668475035648&amp;lang=en&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fmirror.xyz%2Flght.eth%2FW1eJkZ4X1fAZBeIX2uEaXPED7_dsm1TmejdXDF65HiE&amp;sessionId=ad7d4b88e36e99b39512dba8a2a5c7f1bd43e3d0&amp;theme=light&amp;widgetsVersion=aaf4084522e3a%3A1674595607486&amp;width=550px" data-tweet-id="1628287668475035648"></iframe></div></div></figure></div>
                                <p>My hunch is that more people would know Beeple at the moment as well. The core instinct coming from the realization that most people (that consume art) are on social media platforms & have likely been fed a Beeple piece in their algorithms at some point.</p>
                                <p>Is Monet in the algorithm at scale?? I think not, and this is the lead of my core instinct.</p>
                                <h2>The meta</h2>
                                <p>Within the piece we have three text bubbles that signify the ‘bridges’ connecting what I’m thinking to the viewer. Trauma, Outrage, For you. In my estimation, these memes are the ‘gatekeepers’ of the current art world (via social media algorithmic search and discovery).</p>
                                <p>It should be acknowledged that social media algorithms helped solve the previous ‘gatekeeper’ dilemma (auction houses, galleries, 1% access, etc). However, this does not absolve it of creating new gatekeepers in the form of conceptual ‘stratafigures’ - tangible code multiplied by intangible human intervention at scale. A wordy, but intentionally descriptive, way of saying we now face Algorithim Art Dealers instead of human ones. The things that push the ‘right’ button on a code set are now the keys to ‘access’ instead of pushing the ‘right’ button on humans.</p>
                                <p>This is not inherently good or bad, yet the current apex of these new AI art dealers (Twitter) is not at all tuned for the art world ironically enough.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Trauma earns attention but is about personal and collective disaster</li>
                                    <li>Outrage earns recognition but is about irrationalism and extremism</li>
                                    <li>For You is a suggestive feed about what the algo values not the industry</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>If the keys to get past gatekeepers are unrelated, and even inhibitory, to the industry in question (decentralized art) it seems obvious that ‘unplanned’ obsolescence is in the cards. And on a more emotional side of things, it could be argued that it is harming individual expression at scale and the compounding effects of its potential success. A problem that is much too great for one individual to solve.</p>
                                <h2>The wrap up</h2>
                                <p>So, I am at the point of my contract where I have expressed what was needed from me. The art piece is a visual expression of this essay. This essay is an intellectual expression of the art piece. I have no claims on knowing the answer to this algo art dealer obstacles, but I have brought forth whatever it was the muse desired from me.</p>
                                <p>If things remain unchanged then I believe Twitter will no longer be the home of onchain tech, art, and decentralized culture.</p>
                                <p>Smells like an opportunity.</p>
